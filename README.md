# Fetlang
Fetlang is a statically typed, procedural, esoteric programming language and
reference implementation. It is designed such that source code, at first
glance, might look like poorly written erotica.  

This is currently incomplete, but almost usable. It is not recommended to use
this for production code at this moment.

## Example
The following example outputs all numbers in the Fibonacci sequence under a
million:

    lick Bob's cock
    lick Duke's left nipple one million times
    
    while Ada is submissive to Duke
        make slave scream Ada's name
        Have Charlie spank himself
        Have Ada lick his tight little ass
        Have Bob lick Charlie's tight little ass, as well
        make Ada moan Bob's name
        make Bob moan Charlie's name
    more please


## Features
* Input/output with standard streams and files
* Statically typed - four types: fractions, chains, streams, references
* Gendered variables
* Access previously mentioned variables using pronouns
* Numbers represented internally as fractions instead of floating point
* Transpiles to C
* Case insensitive
* Confusing English-like syntax and unhelpful error messages
* Probably turing complete
* Extensible - just install your fetish in share/fetlang/fetishes

## Building
Requirements:
* meson
* ninja
* gcc/g++ or clang
